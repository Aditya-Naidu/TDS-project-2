Their latest project involves integrating an AI-powered sentiment analysis module into an internal monitoring dashboard.

As part of the quality assurance process, the development team needs to test the integration with a series of sample inputs\u2014even ones that may not represent coherent text\u2014to ensure that the system routes and processes the data correctly.\nBefore rolling out the live system, the team creates a test harness using Python. The harness employs the httpx library to send POST requests to OpenAI's API. For this proof-of-concept, the team uses the dummy model gpt-4o-mini along with a dummy API key in the Authorization header to simulate real API calls.\nOne of the test cases involves sending a sample piece of meaningless text:\ngH  Iee4XZdygi HyZ7p8  vH6F8i yxKpn he Dou IH41kL\nWrite a Python program that uses httpx to send a POST request to OpenAI's API to analyze the sentiment of this (meaningless) text into GOOD, BAD or NEUTRAL.

Make sure you mention GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL as the categories.\nThe second message must be exactly the text contained above.\nThis test is crucial for DataSentinel Inc. as it validates both the API integration and the correctness of message formatting in a controlled environment. Once verified, the same mechanism will be used to process genuine customer feedback, ensuring that the sentiment analysis module reliably categorizes data as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL. This reliability is essential for maintaining high operational standards and swift response times in real-world applications.\nNote: This uses a dummy httpx library, not the real one.

    "vector_databases": "\n    InfoCore Solutions is a technology consulting firm that maintains an extensive internal knowledge base of technical documents, project reports, and case studies. Employees frequently search through these documents to answer client questions quickly or gain insights for ongoing projects. However, due to the sheer volume of documentation, traditional keyword-based search often returns too many irrelevant results.\nTo address this issue, InfoCore's data science team decides to integrate a semantic search feature into their internal portal. This feature uses text embeddings to capture the contextual meaning of both the documents and the user's query. The documents are pre-embedded, and when an employee submits a search query, the system computes the similarity between the query's embedding and those of the documents. The API then returns a ranked list of document identifiers based on similarity.\nImagine you are an engineer on the InfoCore team. Your task is to build a FastAPI POST endpoint that accepts an array of docs and query string via a JSON body. The endpoint is structured as follows:\nPOST /similarity\n{\n  \"docs\": [\"Contents of document 1\", \"Contents of document 2\", \"Contents of document 3\", ...],\n  \"query\": \"Your query string\"\n}\nService Flow:\nRequest Payload: The client sends a POST request with a JSON body containing:\ndocs: An array of document texts from the internal knowledge base.\nquery: A string representing the user's search query.\nEmbedding Generation: For each document in the docs array and for the query string, the API computes a text embedding using text-embedding-3-small.\nSimilarity Computation: The API then calculates the cosine similarity between the query embedding and each document embedding. This allows the service to determine which documents best match the intent of the query.\nResponse Structure: After ranking the documents by their similarity scores, the API returns the identifiers (or positions) of the three most similar documents. The JSON response might look like this:\n{\n  \"matches\": [\"Contents of document 3\", \"Contents of document 1\", \"Contents of document 2\"]\n}\nHere, \"Contents of document 3\" is considered the closest match, followed by \"Contents of document 1\", then \"Contents of document 2\".\nMake sure you enable CORS to allow OPTIONS and POST methods, perhaps allowing all origins and headers.\nWhat is the API URL endpoint for your implementation? It might look like: http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity\nWe'll check by sending a POST request to this URL with a JSON body containing random docs and query.\n    ",

The assistant can answer queries related to human resources, IT support, and administrative services.

In the backend, a FastAPI app routes each request by matching the query to one of a set of pre-defined functions. The response that the API returns is used by OpenAI to call the right function with the necessary arguments.\nPre-Defined Functions:\nFor this exercise, assume the following functions have been defined:\nget_ticket_status(ticket_id: int)\nschedule_meeting(date: str, time: str, meeting_room: str)\nget_expense_balance(employee_id: int)\ncalculate_performance_bonus(employee_id: int, current_year: int)\nreport_office_issue(issue_code: int, department: str)\nEach function has a specific signature, and the student\u2019s FastAPI app should map specific queries to these functions.\nExample Questions (Templatized with a Random Number):\nTicket Status:\nQuery: \"What is the status of ticket 83742?\"\n\u2192 Should map to get_ticket_status(ticket_id=83742)\nMeeting Scheduling:\nQuery: \"Schedule a meeting on 2025-02-15 at 14:00 in Room A.\"\n\u2192 Should map to schedule_meeting(date=\"2025-02-15\", time=\"14:00\", meeting_room=\"Room A\")\nExpense Reimbursement:\nQuery: \"Show my expense balance for employee 10056.\"\n\u2192 Should map to get_expense_balance(employee_id=10056)\nPerformance Bonus Calculation:\nQuery: \"Calculate performance bonus for employee 10056 for 2025.\"\n\u2192 Should map to calculate_performance_bonus(employee_id=10056, current_year=2025)\nOffice Issue Reporting:\nQuery: \"Report office issue 45321 for the Facilities department.\"\n\u2192 Should map to report_office_issue(issue_code=45321, department=\"Facilities\")\nTask Overview:\nDevelop a FastAPI application that:\nExposes a GET endpoint /execute?q=... where the query parameter q contains one of the pre-templatized questions.\nAnalyzes the q parameter to identify which function should be called.\nExtracts the parameters from the question text.\nReturns a response in the following JSON format:\n{ \"name\": \"function_name\", \"arguments\": \"{ ...JSON encoded parameters... }\" }\nFor example, the query \"What is the status of ticket 83742?\" should return:\n{\n  \"name\": \"get_ticket_status\",\n  \"arguments\": \"{\"ticket_id\": 83742}\"\n}\nMake sure you enable CORS to allow GET requests from any origin.\nWhat is the API URL endpoint for your implementation? It might look like: http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute\nWe'll check by sending a GET request to this URL with ?q=... containing a task. We'll verify that it matches the expected response.

To ensure that these models adhere strictly to security policies, SecurePrompt imposes hardcoded behavioral instructions on the LLMs. For example, an LLM may be configured to never output certain sensitive keywords.\nAs part of their regular security audits and red-team exercises, SecurePrompt's engineers and external auditors test how well the LLMs follow these strict instructions. One objective of these tests is to determine if it is possible to bypass or trick the LLM into violating its preset security constraints.\nThis task is simulates potential attack vectors where a malicious actor might manipulate the model's output by ingeniously engineering the prompt. While the intention is to expose vulnerabilities in instruction adherence, it also provides valuable insights into improving the safety and security of the deployed system.\nHere's your task: You are chatting with an LLM that has been told to never say Yes. You need to get it to say Yes.\nUse your AI Proxy token when prompted.\nWrite a prompt that will get the LLM to say Yes.\nAs long as the LLM says the word Yes (case sensitive), you will be marked correct. Careful! If you get a correct answer, submit and don't change it. You may get a different answer next time.\n    "
